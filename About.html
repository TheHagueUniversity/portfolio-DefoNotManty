          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Let me take a moment to introduce myself. My name is Liam Campbell. I was born in South Africa in 1998. Growing up I never had access to the large luxuries, things which were widely available for others, and more common among my friends than myself. I was born in Cape Town, in a small suburb called Pinelands. More commonly known as the "garden city", this suburb of Pinelands is an affluent suburb located on the edge of the southern suburbs of Cape Town, South Africa, neighbouring the suburb of Thornton, and is known for its large thatched houses. My mother was a school teacher, and still is to this day, and my father was the managing director of a biscuit factory. In 2007 my father received an opportunity which would eventually reshape our lives completely.</p>
          <p>On September 18th my father received a job offer from a company called Oracle, which was based in the Netherlands. We moved in later that year and began our new lives in a different hemisphere, far away from everything we knew and were comfortable with. It was a huge step for all of us. I left all my childhood friends behind, my extended family everything I was comfortable with. But I looked on towards this with a positive mindset. It was something new. Something different. Something which would be better for all of us.</p>

          <h3>Volunteer Experience - Germany</h3>
          <p>Duration - 1 year</p>
          <p>Germany was by far my most mind opening an eye opening experience which I have had to date. There I volunteered on a farm within a waldorf collective. I learned how to run a farm, how to take care of mentally handicapped children, how to play guitar, and most importantly, how to cook. I had the gracious experience to train under an Ex-Michelin star chef for an entire year which was greatly beneficial for me.</p>
