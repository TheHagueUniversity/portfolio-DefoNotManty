          <h3>Project 1 - Where It All Began. </h3>
          <p>This was my very first attempt at designing a piece of digital artwork. As such, this is an incredibly special image for me. I began this undertaking  with no knowledge of graphic design, no skills in image manipulation, nor any real expertise using Phtoshop or other programs which were listed under image manipualtion.  I was always one to learn on the go however, and with that in mind, I dove head first into the world of digital manipulation and graphic design. In total, it took about 2 weeks of learnign everyday to complete this piece and still today, 3 years later, I can spot mistakes, ways to make it better etc.</p>

        <h3>My First Still-Life/ Digital Blend Attempt </h3>
        <p>My goal was to capture the dawn's rays upon the early morning mist in a special location within a forest close to heart and to home. My idea about this was to try and blend the real world with abstract design. It paid of superbly I believe, and I am very happy with the result. This image was also a career Kickstarter for me in commissioned work as it was the defining piece of art which caught the attention of someone who would later become a partner of mine where I would, in essence be working as a graphic designer for him.</p>

        <h3>My Very First Commission </h3>
        <p>This was an incredible experience for me. My very first opportunity to actually earn money from a piece of digital art. I dove forward with enthusiasm. My contractor, group leader who was wanting to expand his business of art promotion for gaming events for a game called Rocket League. The design was at first a challenge for me, as I had never had to experience the stress of designing for someone other than myself.</p>

        <h3>My Latest and Biggest Commission To Date</h3>
<p>Destiny 2 is a free-to-play online-only multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie. It was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on September 6, 2017, followed by a Microsoft Windows version the following month. With that being said, I was approached by a multi-game clan to design a piece of promotional artwork for them. Numbering in the thousands and offering a substantial amount for this design, this was going to be my big break. I set out to create something original, something which I had never designed before, something to catch the eye.</p>
